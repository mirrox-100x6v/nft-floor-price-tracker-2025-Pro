## 🔄 Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how an **nft-floor-price-tracker** would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

It's crucial to understand from the outset that these two worlds—**NFT marketplaces** (like OpenSea, Blur) and **centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs)**—are largely separate. The integration is not direct; it's a bridge built by the tracker application.

Here’s a breakdown of the process:

---

### The Core Concept: A Bridged Ecosystem

An `nft-floor-price-tracker` does not interact with NFT marketplaces and CEXs in a single, unified API call. Instead, it acts as a central "brain" that:
1.  **Monitors** NFT markets for data.
2.  **Analyzes** the data based on user-defined rules.
3.  **Executes** trades on CEXs based on that analysis.

The entire workflow can be visualized as follows, highlighting the separate connections to NFT Marketplaces and Crypto Exchanges:
